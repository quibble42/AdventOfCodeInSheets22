# AdventOfCodeInSheets22
Advent of Code, a globally recognized yearly coding challenge, solved using only Google Sheets.

Here is the Advent of Code 2022's website, to follow along: https://adventofcode.com/2022

The Advent of Code is a coding challenge that gets harder with each day, up until day 25 [Christmas].
For context, a beginner making it to day 10 is impressive.
These problems regularly deal with matrices, data manipulation, advanced mathematics, and so on, making it very difficult for Google Sheets/Excel.

Given that Sheets/Excel is not able to hold a variable in the traditional sense, nor perform 'loops', I found using it a beneficial exercise for my own expertise.
I made it to about day 8 before Google Sheets became non-performant and could no longer process the math appropriately.

This is a proof-of-concept, so if you have any questions please e-mail me directly as there aren't many notes.
